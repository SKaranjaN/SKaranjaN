I'm a software engineer with a love for backend web development. I'm currently working with React and Flask a Python framework to create easy-to-use and beautiful web apps. I strive to make the technology industry more accessible to aspiring developers and engineers by creating content to share the mistakes I've made and lessons I've learned along my software engineering journey so far.
